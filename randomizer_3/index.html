        <p>Omikuji are random fortunes written on strips of paper at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples in Japan. Literally "sacred lot", these are usually received by making a small offering (generally a five-yen coin as it is considered good
          luck)
          and randomly choosing one from a box, hoping for the resulting fortune to be good. Another method of getting a fortune slip would be to shake an omikuji box until a wooden stick with a number label falls out. The number on the stick would then
          correspond to a specific set of fortune slips.</p>

      <div class="two column">
        <p>The individual fortunes contain a general fortune that can range from great blessing (<span class="chinese">大吉</span>) to great curse (<span class="chinese">大凶</span>). Specific aspects of one's life are then listed, which can include any number of possible combinations depending on the shrine and/or temple in question. In this case, the aspects included are romantic relationships (<span class="chinese">恋愛</span>), illness (<span class="chinese">病気</span>), money luck (<span class="chinese">金錢運</span>), and lucky item (<span class="chinese">吉祥物</span>).
